\section{Introduction}
Thermal state preparation occupies a unique spot in quantum information sciences: Preparing thermal states for arbitrary Hamiltonians for arbitrary temperatures is $QMA$-Hard, however thermal states are incredibly useful inputs whenever low energy states are needed, such as when training Boltzmann machines \cite{}, preparing ground states for quantum error correcting codes \cite{}, or starting states for chemistry simulations \cite{}.
