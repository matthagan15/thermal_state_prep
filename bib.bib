	abstract = {Relaxation to a thermal state is the inevitable fate of non-equilibrium interacting quantum systems without special conservation laws. While thermalization in one-dimensional (1D) systems can often be suppressed by integrability mechanisms, in two spatial dimensions thermalization is expected to be far more effective due to the increased phase space. In this work we propose a general framework for escaping or delaying the emergence of the thermal state in two-dimensional (2D) arrays of Rydberg atoms via the mechanism of quantum scars, i.e. initial states that fail to thermalize. The suppression of thermalization is achieved in two complementary ways: by adding local perturbations or by adjusting the driving Rabi frequency according to the local connectivity of the lattice. We demonstrate that these mechanisms allow to realize robust quantum scars in various two-dimensional lattices, including decorated lattices with non-constant connectivity. In particular, we show that a small decrease of the Rabi frequency at the corners of the lattice is crucial for mitigating the strong boundary effects in two-dimensional systems. Our results identify synchronization as an important tool for future experiments on two-dimensional quantum scars.},

We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden.},

	abstract = {The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has played a major role in explaining thermodynamic phenomena in closed quantum systems. However, no connection has been known between ETH and the timescale of thermalization for open system dynamics. This paper rigorously shows that ETH indeed implies fast thermalization to the global Gibbs state. We show fast convergence for two models of thermalization. In the first, the system is weakly coupled to a bath of quasi-free Fermions that we routinely refresh. We derive a finite-time version of Davies' generator, with explicit error bounds and resource estimates, that describes the joint evolution. The second is Quantum Metropolis Sampling, a quantum algorithm for preparing Gibbs states on a quantum computer. In both cases, no guarantee for fast convergence was previously known for non-commuting Hamiltonians, partly due to technical issues with a finite energy resolution. The critical feature of ETH we exploit is that operators in the energy basis can be modeled by independent random matrices in a near-diagonal band. We show this gives quantum expander at nearby eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. This then implies fast convergence to the global Gibbs state by mapping the problem to a one-dimensional classical random walk on the energy eigenstates. Our results explain finite-time thermalization in chaotic open quantum systems and suggest an alternative formulation of ETH in terms of quantum expanders, which we investigate numerically for small systems.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a quasi-polynomial time classical algorithm that estimates the partition function of quantum many-body systems at temperatures above the thermal phase transition point. It is known that in the worst case, the same problem is NP-hard below this point. Together with our work, this shows that the transition in the phase of a quantum system is also accompanied by a transition in the hardness of approximation. We also show that in a system of n particles above the phase transition point, the correlation between two observables whose distance is at least log(n) decays exponentially. We can improve the factor of log(n) to a constant when the Hamiltonian has commuting terms or is on a 1D chain. The key to our results is a characterization of the phase transition and the critical behavior of the system in terms of the complex zeros of the partition function. Our work extends a seminal work of Dobrushin and Shlosman on the equivalence between the decay of correlations and the analyticity of the free energy in classical spin models. On the algorithmic side, our result extends the scope of a recent approach due to Barvinok for solving classical counting problems to quantum many-body systems.},

	abstract = {The partition function and free energy of a quantum many-body system determine its physical properties in thermal equilibrium. Here we study the computational complexity of approximating these quantities for n-qubit local Hamiltonians. First, we report a classical algorithm with poly(n) runtime which approximates the free energy of a given 2-local Hamiltonian provided that it satisﬁes a certain denseness condition. Our algorithm combines the variational characterization of the free energy and convex relaxation methods. It contributes to a body of work on eﬃcient approximation algorithms for dense instances of optimization problems which are hard in the general case, and can be viewed as simultaneously extending existing algorithms for (a) the ground energy of dense 2-local Hamiltonians, and (b) the free energy of dense classical Ising models. Secondly, we establish polynomial-time equivalence between the problem of approximating the free energy of local Hamiltonians and three other natural quantum approximate counting problems, including the problem of approximating the number of witness states accepted by a QMA veriﬁer. These results suggest that simulation of quantum many-body systems in thermal equilibrium may precisely capture the complexity of a broad family of computational problems that has yet to be deﬁned or characterized in terms of known complexity classes. Finally, we summarize state-ofthe-art classical and quantum algorithms for approximating the free energy and show how to improve their runtime and memory footprint.},

Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble. A more detailed statement of this is named the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.},

In the high-temperature (low β) regime, their algorithm has sample complexity poly(N, 1/β, 1/ε) and can be implemented with polynomial, but suboptimal, time complexity. In this paper, we study the same question for a more general class of Hamiltonians. We show how to learn the coeﬃcients of a Hamiltonian to error ε with sample complexity S = O(log N/(βε)2) and time complexity linear in the sample size, O(SN ). Furthermore, we prove a matching lower bound showing that our algorithm’s sample complexity is optimal, and hence our time complexity is also optimal.},

The entropy bound is exponential in the correlation length of the state, thus reproducing as a particular case Hastings proof of an area law for groundstates of 1D gapped Hamiltonians. As a consequence, we show that 1D quantum states with exponential decay of correlations have an efficient classical approximate description as a matrix product state of polynomial bond dimension, thus giving an equivalence between injective matrix product states and states with a finite correlation length. The result can be seen as a rigorous justification, in one dimension, of the intuition that states with exponential decay of correlations, usually associated with non-critical phases of matter, are simple to describe. It also has implications for quantum computing: It shows that unless a pure state quantum computation involves states with long-range correlations, decaying at most algebraically with the distance, it can be efficiently simulated classically. The proof relies on several previous tools from quantum information theory - including entanglement distillation protocols achieving the hashing bound, properties of single-shot smooth entropies, and the quantum substate theorem - and also on some newly developed ones. In particular we derive a new bound on correlations established by local random measurements, and we give a generalization to the max-entropy of a result of Hastings concerning the saturation of mutual information in multiparticle systems. The proof can also be interpreted as providing a limitation on the phenomenon of data hiding in quantum states.},

We require both properties to hold for the thermal state of the Hamiltonian on any induced subgraph of the original lattice. Assumption (ii) is satisﬁed for all commuting Gibbs states, while assumption (i) is satisﬁed for every model above a critical temperature. Both assumptions are satisﬁed in one spatial dimension. Moreover, both assumptions are expected to hold above the thermal phase transition for models without any topological order at ﬁnite temperature. As a building block, we show that exponential decay of correlation (for thermal states of Hamiltonians on all induced subgraphs) is sufﬁcient to efﬁciently estimate the expectation value of a local observable.

	abstract = {Fluctuation theorems provide a correspondence between properties of quantum systems in thermal equilibrium and a work distribution arising in a non-equilibrium process that connects two quantum systems with Hamiltonians \$H\_0\$ and \$H\_1=H\_0+V\$. Building upon these theorems, we present a quantum algorithm to prepare a purification of the thermal state of \$H\_1\$ at inverse temperature \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}ge 0\$ starting from a purification of the thermal state of \$H\_0\$. The complexity of the quantum algorithm, given by the number of uses of certain unitaries, is \${\textbackslash}tilde \{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(e{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}beta ({\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}! A- w\_l)/2\})\$, where \${\textbackslash}Delta {\textbackslash}! A\$ is the free-energy difference between \$H\_1\$ and \$H\_0,\$ and \$w\_l\$ is a work cutoff that depends on the properties of the work distribution and the approximation error \${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textgreater}0\$. If the non-equilibrium process is trivial, this complexity is exponential in \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}{\textbar}V{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$, where \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}V{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$ is the spectral norm of \$V\$. This represents a significant improvement of prior quantum algorithms that have complexity exponential in \${\textbackslash}beta {\textbackslash}{\textbar}H\_1{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$ in the regime where \${\textbackslash}{\textbar}V{\textbackslash}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}ll {\textbackslash}{\textbar}H\_1{\textbackslash}{\textbar}\$. The dependence of the complexity in \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ varies according to the structure of the quantum systems. It can be exponential in \$1/{\textbackslash}epsilon\$ in general, but we show it to be sublinear in \$1/{\textbackslash}epsilon\$ if \$H\_0\$ and \$H\_1\$ commute, or polynomial in \$1/{\textbackslash}epsilon\$ if \$H\_0\$ and \$H\_1\$ are local spin systems. The possibility of applying a unitary that drives the system out of equilibrium allows one to increase the value of \$w\_l\$ and improve the complexity even further. To this end, we analyze the complexity for preparing the thermal state of the transverse field Ising model using different non-equilibrium unitary processes and see significant complexity improvements.},

            The investigation of thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems has a long history, dating back to the time of developing statistical mechanics. Most quantum many-body systems in nature are considered to thermalize, while some never achieve thermal equilibrium. The central problem is to clarify whether a given system thermalizes, which has been addressed previously, but not resolved. Here, we show that this problem is undecidable. The resulting undecidability even applies when the system is restricted to one-dimensional shift-invariant systems with nearest-neighbour interaction, and the initial state is a fixed product state. We construct a family of Hamiltonians encoding dynamics of a reversible universal Turing machine, where the fate of a relaxation process changes considerably depending on whether the Turing machine halts. Our result indicates that there is no general theorem, algorithm, or systematic procedure determining the presence or absence of thermalization in any given Hamiltonian.},
